  "readme": "# stream-http [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jhiesey/stream-http.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jhiesey/stream-http)\n\n[![Sauce Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/stream-http.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/stream-http)\n\nThis module is an implementation of node's native `http` module for the browser.\nIt tries to match node's api and behavior as closely as possible, but some features\naren't available, since browsers don't give nearly as much control over requests.\n\nThis is heavily inspired by, and intended to replace, [http-browserify](https://github.com/substack/http-browserify)\n\n## What does it do?\n\nIn accordance with its name, `stream-http` tries to provide data to its caller before\nthe request has completed whenever possible.\n\nThe following browsers support true streaming, where only a small amount of the request\nhas to be held in memory at once:\n* Chrome >= 43 (using the `fetch` api)\n* Firefox >= 9 (using `moz-chunked-arraybuffer` responseType with xhr)\n\nThe following browsers support pseudo-streaming, where the data is available before the\nrequest finishes, but the entire response must be held in memory:\n* Chrome\n* Safari >= 5, and maybe older\n* IE >= 10\n* Most other Webkit-based browsers, including the default Android browser\n\nAll browsers newer than IE8 support binary responses. All of the above browsers that\nsupport true streaming or pseudo-streaming support that for binary data as well\nexcept for IE10. Old (presto-based) Opera also does not support binary streaming either.\n\n## How do you use it?\n\nThe intent is to have the same api as the client part of the\n[node HTTP module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html). The interfaces are the same wherever\npractical, although limitations in browsers make an exact clone of the node api impossible.\n\nThis module implements `http.request`, `http.get`, and most of `http.ClientRequest`\nand `http.IncomingMessage` in addition to `http.METHODS` and `http.STATUS_CODES`. See the\nnode docs for how these work.\n\n### Extra features compared to node\n\n* The `options.withCredentials` boolean flag, used to indicate if the browser should send\ncookies or authentication information with a CORS request. Default true.\n\nThis module has to make some tradeoffs to support binary data and/or streaming. Generally,\nthe module can make a fairly good decision about which underlying browser features to use,\nbut sometimes it helps to get a little input from the user.\n\n* The `options.mode` field passed into `http.request` or `http.get` can take on one of the\nfollowing values:\n  * 'default' (or any falsy value, including undefined): Try to provide partial data before\nthe equest completes, but not at the cost of correctness for binary data. In some cases\nthe implementation may be a bit slow.\n  * 'prefer-stream': Provide data before the request completes even if binary data (anything\nthat isn't a single-byte ASCII or utf8 character) will be corrupted. Of course, this option\nis only safe for text data.\n  * 'prefer-fast': Use an implementation that does less processing even if it means that\npartial data isn't available. This is particularly useful when making large requests in\na browser like Safari that has a weaker javascript engine.\n\n### Features missing compared to node\n\n* `http.Agent` is only a stub\n* The 'socket', 'connect', 'upgrade', and 'continue' events on `http.ClientRequest`.\n* Any operations, including `request.setTimeout`, that operate directly on the underlying\nsocket.\n* Any options that are disallowed for security reasons. This includes setting or getting\ncertian headers.\n* `message.httpVersion`\n* `message.rawHeaders` is modified by the browser, and may not quite match what is sent by\nthe server.\n* `message.trailers` and `message.rawTrailers` will remain empty.\n\n## Example\n\n``` js\nhttp.get('/bundle.js', function (res) {\n\tvar div = document.getElementById('result');\n\tdiv.innerHTML += 'GET /beep<br>';\n\t\n\tres.on('data', function (buf) {\n\t\tdiv.innerHTML += buf;\n\t});\n\t\n\tres.on('end', function () {\n\t\tdiv.innerHTML += '<br>__END__';\n\t});\n})\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT.
